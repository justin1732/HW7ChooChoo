# Train Scheduler Firebase and HTML App
## Welcome to Union Station!

This was the final individual project before we went into our first group project from the University of Denver FullStack Coding Bootcamp.

This app display something similar to a Train Scheduler to see when trains are arriving and departing. Users can also add a train destination as well through Firebase.

## Using the App on Github

This app is deployed at https://justin1732.github.io/HW7ChooChoo/

## Starting the app locally

For a local version, I recommend using Visual Studio Code. Navigate over to my GitHub repo, located at https://github.com/justin1732/HW7ChooChoo , click clone, and be sure to type in the following below:
git clone
Then navigate to the HTML file and load it.

## Using this application

Users can see destinations and frequencies already loaded into the app. Users can also add destinations and frequencies in the blank forms provided. Please be sure to fill out all the information in the appropriate format.

## Technologies Used

This application uses primarily HTML, Basic CSS, and Bootstrap CSS for rendering and viewing the elements. The app uses JQuery JS, Ajax, and Moment JS to translate the information received from the user and the database into a readable format. Finally, this app uses Firebase to add and display destinations.
